    <head>Hollow Knight is peak!</head>
    <p>In <a href="https://www.hollowknight.com/">Hollow Knight</a>, you will have fun exploring <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Hallownest"> Hallownest</a>, trecking through the empty <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Forgotten_Crossroads">Forgotten Crossroads </a>, the lush greenery of <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Greenpath">Greenpath</a>, and even the beautiful <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/White_Palace"> White Palace.</a>
      Though, you will have to fight enemies, ramping up in difficulty as you progress. 
      Bosses can range from the easy <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/False_Knight">False Knight</a>, all the way to the painful <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Absolute_Radiance">Absolute Radiance. </a>
      There is even difficult platforming, like the infamous Path of Pain.
      As soon as you unlock Dash and Mantis Claw, you will be able to achieve an unlimited amount of platforming.</p>
